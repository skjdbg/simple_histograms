# simple_histograms
## A very basic and simple of use Rust implementation of a histogram.

**This library is meant to plot histograms, not calculate quantiles, median, etc which other libraries already do.**

**Disclaimer**  
I am no expert. If you find another library that does the same, it probably does it better and faster. I don't know if I will ever update this project or add any functionalities.  
**No test have been run on this project**

I created this library for two reasons :
- I wanted to make histograms and plot them from vectors without having to write 20 lines of code and interacting with multiple libraries. I found some that created a histogram but none that allowed to directly plot them (or maybe i was too dumb to realize they did), or they required too much boilerplate.
- I'm new to rust and it's a good exercice. (expect errors)
