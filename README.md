# simple_histograms
## A very basic and simple of use Rust implementation of a histogram.

**This library is meant to plot histograms, not calculate quantiles, median, etc which other libraries already do.**

**No test have been run on this project**

I created this library for two reasons :
- I wanted to make histograms and plot them from vectors without having to write 20 lines of code and interacting with multiple libraries. I found some that created a histogram but none that allowed to directly plot them (or maybe i was too dumb to realize they did), or they required too much boilerplate.
- I'm new to rust and it's a good exercice.
